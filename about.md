Hi, 
I’m Leonardo from Brazil, currently studying Information Technology(a.k.a I.T) at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte][link-ufrn], in my high schools years i was really introduced to programming, months prior to that, i was already “programming” my gamemode for one of my favorites games at the time, took me months to finish a decent gamemode in [pawn][link-pawn], [pawn][link-pawn] is a language similar to C, it was pretty fun. In my high school years i had learn c# and outside of it c/c++ too just because it had a similar syntax and i could apply my knowledge in a more lower level.

In my university years i’ve been expanding my knowledge about other languanges such like Python, Ruby and Php and tools such like Django for Python and Laravel for php. The usage of such tools lead to me to learn some other tools or techniques that are the standard way to make a project in such tools. One is the concept of API, what it is? it’s basically an “interface” to communicate between applications, it’s userful for sharing info between applications. It is a little bit advanced and tricky to make a reliable API. There are other things that i’ve come to learn which is HTML and Javascript, those things are essential to bulding a web application. In my highschool years i had contact with them but i found it boring, nowdays, not so much, it is so powerful and once you get good enough at it you can make beatiful websites, applications for desktop and mobile with react or other similar tools.
